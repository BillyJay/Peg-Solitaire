Games of peg solitaire take place on a board with an arrangement of holes of a certain number of pegs that occupy the hole. Usually all holes but one are occupied by pegs. In a single move the player takes a peg, jumps it over a neighboring peg and inserts it into a hole and removes the jumped over peg. Thus in each move the number of pegs reduces by one. The game terminates when no more moves are possible. The goal is remove the maximum number of pegs.
